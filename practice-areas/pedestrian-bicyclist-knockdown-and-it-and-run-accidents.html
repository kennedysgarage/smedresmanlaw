      <p>We all know that New York is a town where you’re expected to hurry up or get out of the way. Unfortunately, that way of life all too often leads to pedestrians and bicyclists getting hit or knocked down by cars, trucks and busses. For three decades the Law Firm of Steven Smedresman has helped injured New Yorkers with their pedestrian or bicyclist knockdown cases.</p>
      <p>Pedestrian knockdown or bicyclist knockdown accidents are often the result of simple carelessness: The usual reasons are carelessness (for example, drivers not watching the road ahead, or being distracted by cell phone calls) or other reasons (alcohol involvement, rushing for work, inexperience). Most auto accidents involve some combination of speed and inattention.</p>
      <p>Injuries from auto accidents are often very severe, physically and psychologically. Neck, head and back injuries often result, and in more severe cases there can be nerve damage, broken or dislocated bones, paralysis, loss of limbs and even death. Being unable to work even for a brief period, and surely for lengthy periods causes serious financial difficulties.</p>
      <p>We will be there every step of the way to help. We’ll initiate a prompt investigation, obtain witness statements and other evidence to prove the case; we’ll make sure your medical claims are filed with the correct insurance company and that your medical bills are paid; we’ll make sure that all possible sources of insurance coverage are looked into and that claims are all put in on a timely basis; we’ll help you find the right doctor for your case if you don’t have one already, and we’ll collect all the medical reports to put forth the strongest possible case. Even if your case involves a hit and run accident or an uninsured car, we can still get you money for your claim, if you act quickly and contact us.</p>
      <p>Many people are often hesitant to bring a claim because the feel that in some way they might have been at fault or contributed to the accident. Even if that’s you, you should call: New York State law provides that fault is allocated between the parties in a common sense, comparative manner by allocating fault between the parties. My job is to fight for you, and put the strongest case possible before the Court. Your job is simple: To get better.</p>
      <p>For thirty years I have dedicated myself to fighting for the interests of the injured and hurt, in court and out, to make sure that the insurance company does the one thing it hates the most: Pay full value on the claim.</p>
      <p>If you or a family member has been injured, or a family member injured or killed in a pedestrian or bicyclist accident in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, you may be entitled to collect money damages.</p>
