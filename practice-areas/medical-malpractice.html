      <p>The consequences of medical malpractice can be devastating and tragic for the patient and family. Cases involving babies born with Cerebral Palsy (caused by a lack of oxygen to a baby’s brain during childbirth), Erb’s palsy (caused by having excessive force placed on a baby during a difficult birth causing damage to the child’s brachial plexus); and cases involving a failure to diagnoses certain cancers on a timely basis, are examples of medical malpractice cases.</p>
      <p>Medical malpractice cases are the most difficult of all personal injury cases to bring to a successful conclusion. It’s not enough to show that a mistake has occurred. To bring a successful case you must show that the error or mistake was so egregious that a jury can conclude the health care professional departed or deviated from all accepted standards of medical care.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that the victims of malpractice and their families need to be certain that they are entrusting their case to an attorney with a long and successful history of handling these types of claims. The firm of Steven Smedresman PC, working with Alan R. Chorne, his partner of many years on such cases, is there to compassionately help your family and aggressively seek justice for you in Court.</p>
      <p>The time frames to initiate a medical malpractice case are often stunningly short. You may have only 90 days to bring a claim against New York City’s Health and Hospital system! If the claim is being brought against a private health care provider then your time frame to bring the case may be as short as two and one-half years. If you suspect you have a claim contact me immediately.</p>
      <p>Thirty years of experience in handling medical malpractice cases has taught me that determining if a medical error rises to the level of professional malpractice requires a dispassionate analysis of the records. One can expect a vigorous defense from the doctor’s or hospital’s attorneys and insurance carriers. Understanding the records and retaining experts for your case is the first and most crucial first step on the road to bringing a successful malpractice claim.</p>
      <p>For thirty years the law firm of Steven Smedresman has dedicated itself to fighting for the interests of victims of medical malpractice by going to Court to make sure that the insurance companies do the one thing they hate the most: Paying out full value on your claim.</p>
      <p>If you have been injured or if a family member has been injured or died as a result of medical malpractice in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, you may well be entitled to collect money damages.</p>
