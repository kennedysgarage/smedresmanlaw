      <h3>Construction Worker Accidents (Labor Law)</h3>

      <p>Some jobs are simply more dangerous than other jobs. If you are a construction worker, or if you have a family member who is a construction worker, you know that working at a construction site exposes workers to acutely dangerous accidents. Falling from a height; being exposed to falling objects; being hit by construction equipment; crush injuries; injuries resulting from falling into ditches or trenches; and electrocution are just some of the great dangers construction workers face every day on the job. For three decades the Law Firm of Steven Smedresman has represented New York’s construction workers with their crucially important on-the-job cases.</p>
      <p>The first step in protecting your rights is to ensure that your worker’s compensation claim is set up. Worker’s compensation laws provide you with coverage for most of your medical expenses and some of your lost wages. You are automatically entitled to these benefits regardless of your own fault in the accident. The worker’s compensation laws provide you with a source of automatic payments that start almost immediately. But the worker’s compensation laws also prevent you from suing your employer or co-workers.</p>
      <p>To get full justice if you’ve been hurt in a construction accident you will need an attorney experienced in suing other parties (so-called “third parties”) who might be legally responsible for your accident. New York’s pro-worker Labor Laws squarely place legal responsibility for a safe place to work on a landowner, general contractor and other parties.</p>
      <p>Bringing a lawsuit against the building owner, general contractor or others requires professional legal representation. Construction worker cases, also known as Labor Law cases, involve an ever-changing and subtle area of law where having the right attorney can mean the difference between winning in court and having your case dismissed. Just as you would want the best surgeon for your surgery, so too do you want the most experienced attorney for your day in Court.</p>
      <p>For thirty years the law firm of Steven Smedresman has dedicated itself to fighting for the interests of construction workers injured and hurt on the job, by going to Court to make sure that the insurance companies do the one thing they hate the most: Paying out full value on your claim.</p>
      <p>If you have been injured or if a family member has been injured or killed in a construction accident in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, you may well be entitled to collect money damages.</p>
