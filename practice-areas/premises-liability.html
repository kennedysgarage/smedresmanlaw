    <div class="col-9">
      <p>Every property owner has a legal responsibility to protect tenants, pedestrians, friends or workers by keeping their property in a safe condition. This legal duty extends to owners of single-family homes, co-op owners, condo owners, owners of apartment buildings, or the City of New York, which owns the streets sidewalks and many other properties.</p>
      <p>A raised slab of concrete, a sloped step, an unlit hallway, an icy sidewalk or a wet floor can all cause serious accidents. For almost three decades the Law Firm of Steven Smedresman has professionally represented injured New Yorkers with their premises liability claims.</p>
      <p>We will be there every step of the way to help. We’ll initiate a prompt investigation, which means we’ll get to the scene immediately to photograph the condition that caused your accident. Never has the expression “a picture is worth 1,000 words” been more true than in the context of cases involving dangerous streets, sidewalk or property conditions which are subject to rapid change or repair, or icy conditions that by their nature change quickly.</p>
      <p>We’ll obtain witness statements and other evidence to prove the case; we’ll make sure your medical claims are filed with the correct insurance company; we’ll help you find the right doctor for your case if you don’t have one already, and we’ll collect all the medical reports to put forth the strongest possible case.</p>
      <p>Cases against the City of New York or the New York City Housing Authority have their own special deadline requirements (broadly speaking, ninety days to file a claim and one year and ninety days to thereafter start a lawsuit). Filing time frames are particularly crucial in such cases, so be sure to contact me immediately if you believe you have a claim against the City or the Housing Authority.</p>
      <p>For almost thirty years I have dedicated myself to fighting for the interests of the injured and hurt, in court and out, to make sure that the insurance company does the one thing it hates the most: Pay full value on the claim.</p>
      <p>If you or your family member has been hurt as a result of a tripping or slipping due to someone’s failure to maintain their property in a safe condition, in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, you may well have the right to bring a claim for money damages.</p>
      <p>When you hire me you’ll get me. I’ll give you my personal cell phone number so you can reach me 24/7. My promise to you is that I will always know exactly what the status of your case and I’ll always return your phone calls.</p>
