      <h3>Wrongful Death</h3>
    </div><!--/col-->
    <div class="col-9">
      <p>There is no tragedy more devastating for a family than the loss of a loved one. When that loss is caused by an accident it is even more incomprehensible. For three decades the Law Firm of Steven Smedresman has compassionately represented New Yorkers with their vitally important wrongful death claims.</p>
      <p>When someone dies as a result of an accident the family he or she leaves behind has the right to bring a claim in Court. Wrongful death claims may include claims for loss of financial support, based on the loss of all the wages the family member would have earned and contributed to the household; loss of pension, retirement or inheritance benefits; expenses associated with the death, including the funeral and medical expenses; the pain and suffering the family member endured before their death; and loss of guidance, companionship and future care.</p>
      <p>Wrongful death cases arise in car accident cases, due to falls and injuries at construction sites, due to defective and dangerous products, or as a consequence of medical malpractice.</p>
      <p>We will be there every step of the way to help. We will initiate a prompt investigation, obtain witness statements and other evidence to prove the case; we will make sure your medical claims are filed with the correct insurance company and that your bills are paid; and we will make sure that all possible sources of insurance coverage are looked into and that claims are all put in on a timely basis.</p>
      <p>For thirty years the law firm of Steven Smedresman has dedicated itself to fighting for the interests of the injured and hurt, in court and out, to make sure that the insurance company does the one thing it hates the most: Pay full value on the claim.</p>
      <p>If your family member has tragically died as a result of any type of accident in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, his or her estate may well have the right to bring a claim for money damages.</p>
