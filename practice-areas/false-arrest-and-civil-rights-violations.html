      <h3>False Arrest and Civil Rights Violations</h3>
    </div><!--/col-->
    <div class="col-9">
      <p>The United States Constitution guarantees each and every citizen freedom from abuses of State power and State and City police powers. If you have been falsely arrested and spent time in jail for a crime you did not commit, or if you have been the victim of police brutality or beating, you may be entitled to money damages. For three decades the Law Firm of Steven Smedresman has vigorously represented injured New Yorkers with their civil rights violations cases.</p>
      <p>Examples of civil rights violations are false arrest and/or wrongful imprisonment; wrongful conviction; police brutality and excessive force; false arrest based on racial profiling; and prosecutorial misconduct</p>
      <p>For anyone who has ever been the victim of abuse of state power you know well how deep an injustice such an event is and how crucial it is to go to Court to correct that great injustice.</p>
      <p>Cases against the City of New York or other public authorities always carry strict time deadlines for filing the claim and for bringing the suit. Such time limits are crucial. Broadly speaking, one has ninety days to file a claim and one year and ninety days to thereafter start a lawsuit against the City of New York. Filing time frames are particularly crucial in civil rights violations cases as such cases often involve municipalities, so be sure to contact me immediately if you believe you have a such a case.</p>
      <p>For thirty years I have dedicated myself to fighting for the interests of the injured and hurt, in court and out, to make sure that my clients receive their measure of justice.</p>
      <p>If your family member has been the victim of a false arrest, false imprisonment or other civil rights violation in New York City, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, or in Nassau, Suffolk or Rockland Counties, you may well be entitled to collect money damages.</p>
