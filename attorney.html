      <h3>Steven Smedresman, P.C.</h3>
    </div><!--/col-->
    <div class="col-9">
      <p>Born and raised in Queens, Steven Smedresman is a proud product of the NYC Board of Education. Mr. Smedresman graduated college from New York University, with Honors, majoring in politics with a minor in economics. Mr. Smedresman received his law degree in 1979 from the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, where he was a member of the first graduating class. His entire education and professional life has been in the City of New York.</p>
      <p>After graduating law school Mr. Smedresman’s career has concentrated on working for victims of accidents, who often find themselves fighting two battles: The first, to get back on their feet medically, socially and economically after an accident; the second, with insurance companies whose business it is not to pay. Mr. Smedresman found early in his career that righting the scales of justice by making the insurance interests pay brought his clients justice, and professional satisfaction to him.</p>
      <p>Mr. Smedresman established his own firm in 1984 and has worked from the same location, 150 Broadway, New York, NY, since 1984. Doing business at one location since 1984 is a testament to rock-solid, reliable, professional service to the community.</p>
      <p>Over the years he has represented literally thousands of clients. He takes great pride in the fact that in all that time not one single bar association letter of complaint has ever been filed against him. Such a track record is a tribute to Mr. Smedresman’s career-long belief that every case he handles is vitally important to his clients. Every case is treated as if it’s the only case in the office.</p>
      <p>When you retain Steven Smedresman you get his personal cell phone number so that you can reach him 24/7. This total dedication to his client’s needs sets him apart from all others.</p>
      <p>Mr. Smedresman is a member in good standing of the New York State Bar, the United States District Court for the Southern and Eastern Districts of York, and Association memberships include the New York State Trial Lawyers Association and the County Lawyer’s Association.</p>
